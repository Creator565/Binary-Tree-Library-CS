# Binary-Tree-Library-CS
A library to create and manage binary trees in C#

Just made this because i saw a video on youtube and then spent the next 3 days doing this project for no apparent reason,
but at least now i have i github repo with something that i haven't seen often on the internet precompiled for
C# like a library so good for you if you wanted this!

Because of the origins of this you can use it wherever you want and you don't have to credit me!
